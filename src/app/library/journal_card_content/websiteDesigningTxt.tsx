            Next was to then begin drawing up some plans on what the site will look like, both desktop and mobile. 
            I began with a site called &#39;Ok, So...&#39;. This was great as it was a much more basic form of Figma, 
            quick and easy to get a low fidelity, skeleton layout of the site but not get too distracted in the details.
        </Typography>
        <Typography component='div' sx={{ marginBottom: 2, fontFamily: 'platypi', color: 'rgb(var(--textColorLight))'  }}>
            Once that was complete and I had a rough layout of what the site was going to look like, it was onto Figma.
        </Typography>
        <Typography component='div' sx={{ marginBottom: 2, fontFamily: 'platypi', color: 'rgb(var(--textColorLight))'  }}>
            I felt as though I had barely scratched the surface with Figma, the sheer about of tools/plug-ins with this 
            site is next level. I used Figma Jam, downloading and using the MUI symbols widget for the icons 
            and Brandfetch plugin for the logos. It was good to spend time during this designing phase, 
            as previously I always felt very pressured to quickly get ideas down as 
            time was usually against me (during the course). 
        </Typography>
        <Typography component='div' sx={{ marginBottom: 2, fontFamily: 'platypi', color: 'rgb(var(--textColorLight))'  }}>
            I find creating the high-fidelity designs far easier to reference later down the 
            line when I&#39;m in the building/styling phase. 
            </Typography>
            <Typography component='div' sx={{ marginBottom: 2, fontFamily: 'platypi', color: 'rgb(var(--textColorLight))'  }}>
            Having an detailed, visual reference to what the website needs to look like speeds up time dramatically, 
            rather than having to think on the fly. The same goes with gathering resources/materials, 
            doing this early on saves time by doing it during the build phase. 
            </Typography>
            <Typography component='div' sx={{ marginBottom: 2, fontFamily: 'platypi', color: 'rgb(var(--textColorLight))'  }}>
            However, the Figma design isn&#39;t set in stone. I am flexible in adding/removing elements 
            as the build phase progresses. 
            </Typography>
            <Typography component='div' sx={{ marginBottom: 2, fontFamily: 'platypi', color: 'rgb(var(--textColorLight))'  }}>
        Once the desktop and mobile versions were complete, along with font(s), background colours and icons etc, 
        it was now time to start adding to my Kanban board and building the site.
